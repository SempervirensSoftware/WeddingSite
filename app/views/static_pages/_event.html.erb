First and foremost, Thank you for coming to share this special day with us.  We will be providing a shuttle between the ceremony and reception spaces, and suggest taking a taxi or public transportation to the ceremony. If your taking a taxi, the entrance at Hayes and Stanyan is the best place to get dropped off.
